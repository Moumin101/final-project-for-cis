# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

#An on-beat combat demo [inspired/based off of the game HI-FI RUSH] coded and animated in Roblox
#OR a basic fighting game demo using Five Night's at Freddy's characters (a silly idea I had in 9th grade)




## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

#I don't plan on collaborating with anyone



## Do you have any questions of your own?

#I don't really have any questions to ask.



# Proposal extended answer

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

*Beat Clash [DEMO]

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

It would be on a baseplate map where players would be able to attack "on beat" [based on the current beat of the song i.e beat 1, 2, 3, or 4]

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

*none

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

*none

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

*I would like to at least implement three basic combo attacks and two heavy attacks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
*Create a perfect timing system [Perfect timing is how much you are on beat with the rhythm of the song]
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

*Somehow, everything is done with more time left to spare than usual. If so, I would at least like to implement aerial attacks and partner attacks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

*My best outcome is what I said before. At LEAST three light attacks and two heavy attacks, along with the Perfect Timing system.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

*I KNOW that I will have to learn a new coding language in a short period of time, so I plan on doing that when I am done with all other classwork. While learning, I would
also have to be learning and applying many different plug-ins that come with the language in order to realize my project. I don't really plan on making it fully fleshed, since my goal is to atleast
implement the basics/difficult parts on my project and turn it in as a final submission
